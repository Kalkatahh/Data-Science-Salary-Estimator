1. the first thing is to think what data sets you want to warm up with.

2. Data Cleaning:
    this is where I set my selenium driver to do all the scrapping task 
        i. first set up the website to scrape the data
        ii. then provide with what specific dataset you need to work on
        iii. set the parameters & study the website behavior
        iv. according to the behavior setup selenium to do the monotonic data scrapping job.
        v. python script to scrape data.
