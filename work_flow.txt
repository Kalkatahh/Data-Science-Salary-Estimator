Data Science Project: DIY
----------------------------


1. the first thing is to think what data sets you want to warm up with.

2. Data Collecting:
    this is where I set my selenium driver to do all the scrapping task 
        i. first set up the website to scrape the data
        ii. then provide with what specific dataset you need to work on
        iii. set the parameters & study the website behavior
        iv. according to the behavior setup selenium to do the monotonic data scrapping job.
        v. python script to scrape data.


3. Data Cleaning:
    this is where I would filter the unwanted data & add the desired data to work
        i. segragate the generated data from the scraper
        ii. create a new branch to work on & a new script for data cleaning
